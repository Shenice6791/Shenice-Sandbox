# DOC-4242 Document payment retries using Meta Tokens

With Meta Tokens, you can collect existing tokens from shoppers, ranked by their chances of completing a successful transaction. Using this method, you can try payment with the highest-ranking token, and if it fails, you can retry payment with the second-ranking token. In addition, this allows you to share tokens across multiple shops under the same company.

Because we care about safeguarding our customer's data, we tokenize their PAN number (Payment Account Number - the 16-18 digits on the front of their credit or debit card). With tokenized payments, the PAN is not transmitted during the transaction, making the payment more secure.

Tokenization is a process of replacing sensitive data with non-sensitive data.

A metatoken is a collection of the shopper's existing tokens (possibly across different shops) for the same shopper, ordered based on how likely they will lead to successful payment.

### Benefits of tokenization

- Increase revenues for businesses, especially those with subscription models.
- Let users share across multiple shops under the same company.
- Offer more secure payment. 
- Reuse of meta-token in retried payment. 

To secure your payment, you can tokenize payments with payment API, Application Programming Interface requests in which a token substitutes the PAN.

In the following API reference, you will find information on interacting with available endpoints. 

### Authentication

Each request to the meta-token must include an API KEY. Set this key to the x-api-key header value, for example:

```
curl https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v68/metaTokens \
-H 'x-api-key: ' \
-H 'content-type: application/JSON \
â€¦
```
### Versioning

The version suffix has the following format: "vXX," where XX is the version number. 

For example:

`` https://checkout-test.adyen.com/v68/metaTokens ``

##### **List of questions that I asked when documenting the feature.**

1. What is the difference between "metatoken" and "meta-token" naming on the document provided?
2. Do I need a merchant account? 
3. Where can I get api key? Is a quick guide needed to provide API keys? 
4. Can you point me to the information about the description of the parameters?
5. How are code snippets samples in a document tested?
